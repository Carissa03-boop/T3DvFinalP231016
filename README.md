<p><b>DV100|Term 1</b></p>

<p><b>Tropical Cruises</b></p>
<p>This is a Cruise Liner Website with an online booking system and it is done using JQuery</p>

<b>Development:</b>

<p>In this project I did a lot of reasearch and I was quite nervous in the beginning of the term! But as the time passed I started to really enjoy the contents of the term. I wached the videos after class to build on my understanding and knowlage, this helped me alot as I had that to refer back to every time. The Live weather widget intrueged me quite a lot becaused it is so cool that you can load live weather data with ajax using your api key! I did struggle a bit with the dynamic part of things but in the end I got it and I am starting to understand why it is much more suffiecient to load things dynamically, as you can update alot of data without changing your HTML every time.</p>
